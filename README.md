# fedinfra-currentreboots

This is (will be) a small CLI tool that administrators will be able to run
during planned outages to see which playbooks are currently being run, by whom,
and which hosts are affected by them.

It makes use of Datagrepper (if datagrepper happens to be down during the
outage at the moment you run this, you should try again
when it's back online).
