# fedinfra-currentreboots

This is (will be) a small CLI tool that administrators will be able to run
during planned outages to see which playbooks are currently being run, by whom,
and which hosts are affected by those.

It make use of Datagrepper (so if datagrepper happens to be down during the
outage at the moment you run this, then you have bad luck and should try again
when it's back).
